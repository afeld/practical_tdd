* an `assert()`, in it's simplest form, checks a boolean and then prints a message whether the value is `true` or not
* most other expecations (RSpec-specific term?) are just built on top of the basic `assert()`
* in RSpec, syntax is `<value>.should(<something>)` or `expect(<value>).to <something>`
