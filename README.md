# Practical TDD

*Understanding Automated Testing*

This project was created because there were very limited resources around learning testing frameworks, and even more importantly, *how* to test.

## Philosophy

For most people, learning about programming doesn't happen by sitting down in front of a book or tutorial and reading it start-to-finish.  Practical TDD is structured in bite-size chunks, that aim to make the material easy to digest in smaller doses.  This structure allows Practical TDD to act as a reference/glossary, but can also act like a tutorial if you follow the [guide](getting_started.md).
