# Practical TDD

*Understanding Automated Testing*

This project was created because there were very limited resources around learning testing frameworks, and even more importantly, *how* to test.  Testing code is important, but the biggest advantage is that it forces you to write code that's testable.  Writing tests forces the writer to reason about the expectations of their code.

## Philosophy

For most people, learning about programming doesn't happen by sitting down in front of a book or tutorial and reading it start-to-finish.  Practical TDD is structured in bite-size chunks, that aim to make the material easy to digest in smaller doses.  This structure allows Practical TDD to act as a reference/glossary, but can also act like a tutorial if you follow the [guide](getting_started.md).
