TDD class

* Mocking vs stubbing and why they are used
* Lib options (ruby, JS server & client, junit, etc)
* Test framework, assertion lib, web framework hooks, runner, build system
* Testing w/ 3rd-party APIs (webmock/nock, VCR)
* Unit, controller, functional, integration
* TDD vs BDD
* How to get started
* Automated builds: watchers, CI (Jenkins, Travis)
* When should I write tests?
* How early should I worry about testing?
* -when you write code that you want to keep
* Examples in Ruby and JS, but skills are transferable
* Selenium-webdriver - explanation & setup
* Headless browsers
* Set up test DB, clean before each test
* *Resources?? Testdrivenjs.com, rspec book*
* *poll about language/framework*
* Structuring your suite
* Learning via tests
* Test the behavior, not the implementation
* Functional style, dependency injection, idempotence
* Guarantee/contract of the interface, ignorant/ambivalent of the implementation
* Test body: setup, action, assertion
    * look into Jim Weirich's "given" for rspec
    * "let"
* Testing code is important, but best part is that it forces you to write code that's testable. Forces writer to reason about the expectations. 
* Pseudocode-driven development
* Writing test framework from scratch? Start server, write assert methods, do method calls and http requests. 
* Re-implementing something forces you to understand it thoroughly- important to not be afraid of your tools. (Zed Shaw)
* Testacular, testum
